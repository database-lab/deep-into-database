## Problem

Write a query to return the scores of each team in the teams table after all matches displayed in the matches table. Points are awarded as follows: zero points for a loss, one point for a tie, and three points for a win. The result should include team name and points, and be ordered by decreasing points. In case of a tie, order by alphabetized team name.
