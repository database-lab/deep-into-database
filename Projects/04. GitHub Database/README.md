# GitHub Database

This is a simulation of Github database schema that I want to implement.

## Project structure
- User logins into its github account.
- User uses email and password, it also has a unique github name.
- User can see its repositories ( Some of them are private ).
- User can add or remove repositories.
- Each user has some followers and some followings.
- User can be a part of organization.
- An organization has some repositories for it self.
- Repository contains files of codes that user has created.
- User can give star to some repositories.
- Each repository has the ability to be forked by any user.
