# PostgresQL

It is a highly stable database management system, backed by more than 20 years of community development which has contributed
to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for
many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.

## PostgresQL vs MySQL

MySQL is a purely relational database management system. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system.
MySQL has limited support of database features like views, triggers, and procedures.

## PostgresQL vs SQL

SQL Server uses Transact-SQL, or T-SQL, which provides all the same functionality of SQL and adds several proprietary programming extensions.
In PostgreSQL, you can use SQL along with its own procedural language PL/pgSQL that allows you to create functions,
trigger procedures, and add control structures to SQL.
